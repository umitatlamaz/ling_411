# Tidyverse

Let us first read in some data. For this, we will read in the nettle climate data from Bodo Winter's book.  

```{r readnettle}
nettle <- read.csv('/Users/umit/materials/data/nettle_1999_climate.csv')
```


Next, let us turn our nettle dataset into a **tibble**. A tibble is a dataframe with some improved capabilities. All we have to do is to call the `as.tibble` on our `nettle` variable and assign it back to the `nettle` variable. Make sure your tidyverse is loaded by running `library(tidyverse)` first.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
nettle <- as_tibble(nettle)
```

Now, you can simply run `nettle` and it will show the head of your dataframe. 

```{r}
nettle
```
