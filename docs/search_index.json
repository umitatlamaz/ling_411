The purpose of these lecture notes is to help remind you some of the R related material we covered in the class. The material here is not intended to be complete and self-contained. These are just lecture notes. You need to attend the classes and Problem Sessions to get a full grasp of the concepts. 1.1 Disclaimer Some of the material in this book are from Pavel Logaçev’s class notes for LING 411. I’m indebted to Pavel for his friendship, guidance and support. Without him LING 411 could not exist in its current form. 1.2 Some great resources Throughout the semester, I will draw on from the following resources. These are just useful resources and feel free to take a look at them as you wish. The great introduction materials developed at the University of Glasgow: https://psyteachr.github.io/, in particular ‘Data Skills for Reproducible Science’. The also pretty great introduction to R and statistics by Danielle Navarro available here. Matt Crump’s ‘Answering Questions with Data’. Primers on a variety of topics: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers Cheat sheets on a variety of topics: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets The following tutorials are great too. ‘The Tidyverse Cookbook’ ‘A Ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R’ ‘R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition’ 1.3 Blocks Code, output, and special functions will be shown in designated boxes. The first box below illustrates a code block. The code block contains code that you can type in your R interpreter as the source code. You can simply copy and paste it in your R code. The second box indicates the output of R given the code in the first box. 2+2 ## [1] 4 Functions will be introduced in grey boxes. The following grey box describes the summary() function. summary(x) Returns the summary statistics of a dataframe. x A dataframe. The following code block uses the summary() function on the mtcars dataframe that comes pre-installed with R. summary(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp ## Min. :10.40 Min. :4.000 Min. : 71.1 Min. : 52.0 ## 1st Qu.:15.43 1st Qu.:4.000 1st Qu.:120.8 1st Qu.: 96.5 ## Median :19.20 Median :6.000 Median :196.3 Median :123.0 ## Mean :20.09 Mean :6.188 Mean :230.7 Mean :146.7 ## 3rd Qu.:22.80 3rd Qu.:8.000 3rd Qu.:326.0 3rd Qu.:180.0 ## Max. :33.90 Max. :8.000 Max. :472.0 Max. :335.0 ## drat wt qsec vs ## Min. :2.760 Min. :1.513 Min. :14.50 Min. :0.0000 ## 1st Qu.:3.080 1st Qu.:2.581 1st Qu.:16.89 1st Qu.:0.0000 ## Median :3.695 Median :3.325 Median :17.71 Median :0.0000 ## Mean :3.597 Mean :3.217 Mean :17.85 Mean :0.4375 ## 3rd Qu.:3.920 3rd Qu.:3.610 3rd Qu.:18.90 3rd Qu.:1.0000 ## Max. :4.930 Max. :5.424 Max. :22.90 Max. :1.0000 ## am gear carb ## Min. :0.0000 Min. :3.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:3.000 1st Qu.:2.000 ## Median :0.0000 Median :4.000 Median :2.000 ## Mean :0.4062 Mean :3.688 Mean :2.812 ## 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:4.000 3rd Qu.:4.000 ## Max. :1.0000 Max. :5.000 Max. :8.000 If you want to learn more about the mtcars dataset, you can simply put a question mark in front of its name, which will show the documentation for the dataset. The documentation will pop up in the Help tab on the bottom right window in RStudio. ?mtcars "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
